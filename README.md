Lossless Image Compression
--

Image Generation: generate + save pbm, pgm, and ppm images

Huffman Coding: Huffman encoding and decoding PGM images, calculating pixel frequencies, generating Huffman nodes, encoding and decoding images, and measuring the mean absolute error between images.

LZ77 Coding: Compression and decompression of PGM images, encoding images using the LZ77 algorithm, decoding LZ77 compressed images, calculating mean absolute error between images, and analyzing compression efficiency through offset and match length histograms.

CALIC Coding: DPCM and CALIC encoding and decoding of PGM images, implementing various prediction rules including CALIC for DPCM encoding, calculating average and standard deviation of absolute prediction errors, and analyzing encoding efficiency through ABSOLUTE prediction error histograms.
